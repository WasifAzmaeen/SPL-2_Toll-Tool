# Toll-Tool
This repository here contains all the files of my project Toll Tool.

During my 2-2, I had a course named Software Project Lab where I had to form a team with 2 other students of my class and make a usable software. My team mates were Zadid Bin Azad and Fahim Arshad Nafis. Zadid Bin Azad proposed the idea of an automated toll management system.

The idea is very simple :
1. Whenever a car passes the toll plaza, a camera will capture a photo of the license plate of the car.
2. Then the unique car registration number will be extracted from the license plate using ocr (optical character recoginization).
3.The rest of the transaction will occur by using that car registration number in the back end.
